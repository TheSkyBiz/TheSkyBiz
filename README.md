ML Systems Engineering | Adaptive LLM Routing | Model Reliability  

I work on adaptive AI systems that study confidence estimation, calibration, and cost–accuracy tradeoffs between small and large language models.

## Research Interests

- Adaptive routing between small and large language models  
- Confidence estimation and uncertainty-aware inference  
- Calibration and overconfidence analysis in transformers  
- Failure mode analysis in NLP systems  
- Efficient inference under resource constraints

## Selected Work

### Adaptive LLM Router  
A task-adaptive routing framework that dynamically escalates queries between small and large models using uncertainty heuristics and systematic cost–accuracy benchmarking.

### Confidence–Correctness Analyzer  
An empirical reliability study measuring calibration error (ECE), overconfidence rates, and temperature scaling effects across transformer models.

### Early-Warning Financial Stress System  
An interpretable classical ML pipeline for time-aware financial risk prediction with lead-time evaluation.
