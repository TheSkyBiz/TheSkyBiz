Machine Learning Systems | LLM Routing | Reliability & Evaluation  

I build adaptive AI systems focused on confidence, calibration, and cost–accuracy tradeoffs between small and large language models.
I love getting my hands dirty in this ever changing world of AI.

## About

Senior Year College Undergrad  

I enjoy designing systems end-to-end — from research idea to working prototype.  
Currently working on adaptive routing between small and large language models, studying confidence signals and failure behavior in transformers.

## Selected Work

### Adaptive LLM Router  
Dynamic escalation between small and large models using uncertainty heuristics and performance benchmarking.

### Confidence–Correctness Analyzer  
Quantitative reliability study measuring ECE, overconfidence rate, and temperature scaling behavior.

### Early-Warning Financial Stress System  
Interpretable classical ML pipeline for time-aware risk prediction.
